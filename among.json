      "description": "The great game that has jumped to fame over the last few days, now comes to Minecraft Bedrock Edition! This map has all the features needed for the Impostor to fool his fellow players. \n\n Among Us TR has all the features of the original game. There is an impostor among the crew.  The work of the crew is to fix different problems of a spaceship to save itself from death, the solutions are simple and fast. They would have no problem if it weren’t for an impostor, whose job is to sabotage the bring of others and finish them off. \n\n How do you win? \n\n The game is very simple and is based on the game Among Us. The crewmembers win if they find out who the impostor is and throw him off the ship, or if they finish all their activities. The impostor wins if the crewmembers do not manage to fix their sabotage in time or if they finish with the crewmembers. \n\n Start\n\n  A minimum of 4 players is recommended to start the game, if not, some things will not work properly or the game experience may not be the desired one. Before starting a game each player must choose a color to identify themselves when reporting a body or for voting. Once everyone has chosen their color you can start the game by clicking on the button on the wooden block.",
