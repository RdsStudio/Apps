Resist the zombies, grab any weapon you can find and kill them all. Your final challenge will be to defeat the Ender Dragon. The loot is scattered around all over the city in the chests. Of course, the first place you should visit is the police department.\n\nAfter you gathered enough gear and resources, you should build an Ender portal. The map is meant to be played in Adventure mode, which means that it has limitations in terms of building stuff. Find the apartment in one of the skyscrapers with signs in it - that is the only place you're allowed to build a portal.",
