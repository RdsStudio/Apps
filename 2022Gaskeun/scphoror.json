      "description": "If you like creepypastas - this addon may be just for you, as it adds the most famous monsters into MCPE. Not all characters will be hostile, mainly because not every one of them has an appropriate behavior. Part of the characters you probably already know - Jeff the killer, Jane the Killer, Slenderman, Squidward, Seed Eater, Strider, Eyeless Jack, and The Rake. The addon would be ideal for horror maps, but it needs some polish done. Rake - is the only mob that will be aggressive towards everyone and everything.\n\nInstallation:\n\nMake sure to enable \"Experimental Gameplay\"",

You're playing as a night guard that was hired to watch for some local pizza restaurant. In the next couple of days, you will discover that you're not the only living creature out there, and you have to survive for the next five days. As for this particular add-on, called FNAF Universe, it will add mobs from the original games - known as animatronics.\n\nYou can't do much with animatronics, except killing them. As for I know, they won't spawn naturally and will not drop any loot. The addon is advised to the fans of the FNAF universe, though. The models of the monsters are well made, and there are almost all of them, from the whole game-series.\n\nPlease install \"FNAF Universe Texture Pack\" too.",
