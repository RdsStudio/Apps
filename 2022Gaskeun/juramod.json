Now it's empty, and the plants started to grow even through the buildings. To make the exploration even more exciting - you can add some dinosaurs manually. The size of the map is gigantic, even when flying to get from one part of the island to another takes some time, not even saying about doing it on foot.",

			"title": "Jurassic park mod",
			"description": "Jurassic park mod is based on the original film and adds several dinosaurs species into Minecraft PE. Mod adds a total of 60 ancient reptiles and takes you into prehistoric ages. You can hunt them, you can tame them, but it's safer to run, especially when you see T. Rex in front of you. Basically, it's ten mods that were combined into one big modification. It is indeed very fun to hang around while knowing that you can become a meal in every minute. The best way to retreat in case you meet some really dangerous reptiles - is to escape on the jeep.\n\nAt the moment, this is definitely one of the most ambitious mods about dinosaurs for Minecraft PE 1.16.10 that we've ever seen. If you want to immerse yourself into the atmosphere of that era, even more, try out Jurassic Park map which you may find at the downloads section.",
