      "description": "Try your luck with King Creeper’s Lucky Blocks! From treasure loot to trash, everything depends on your luck! Works in the new 1.16 update and has no bugs so far. This is a first release so I’m open to suggestions on drop rates, loot and other stuff. Until then, go ahead and check out this add-on!\n\nBe sure to turn on EXPERIMENTAL GAMEPLAY to avoid bugs.\n\nThis is my version of the famous Lucky Block. This version works for 1.16 because instead of making it an actual block, it’s an entity! You can place it down, punch it, and get loot. Don’t forget to turn on EXPERIMENTAL GAMEPLAY!\n\nLucky Blocks drop random loot, and can range from rare treasures and items to trash items you wouldn’t really need, it all depends on how lucky you are.\n\nTo get a Lucky Block, look around you for a gilded creeper. Gilded creepers are neutral utility mobs that will trade with players, and also attack monsters. It is strong and will attack you if you accidentally hit it, so be careful. Gilded creepers spawn on the surface the same way animals do, you’ll know when they’re nearby when you see a message pop up on the top left.",
